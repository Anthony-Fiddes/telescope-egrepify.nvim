# telescope-egripfy.nvim

This [telescope.nvim](https://github.com/nvim-telescope/telescope.nvim)-extension is my personal alternative to [telescope-live-grep-args.nvim](https://github.com/nvim-telescope/telescope-live-grep-args.nvim).

It will allow you to easily build custom functionality for shorthands to create `ripgrep` flags on-the-fly seamlessly.

# DISCLAIMER

Please consider forking or well-formed PRs instead of issues to add your functionality. This extension foremost serves my own needs and turned into a plugin as maybe other users may want to personalize `rg` via `telescope.nvim` in similar fashion.

# Naming

Kudos to ChatGPT:

> `egrepify` combines the concept of "grep" (a common Unix command for searching through files) with the word "Epsilon" (the fifth letter of the Greek alphabet, which can represent "my" in mathematical notation). The resulting word suggests a personalized or customized version of grep.
